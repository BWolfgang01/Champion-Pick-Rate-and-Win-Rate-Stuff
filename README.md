This is a project that collects win and pick rate from op.gg, applies a normal distribution to both along with a "weight" based on their importance (in my opinion), and creates a power level for each champion. Champions are then put in a top 5 list based on this power level.


Currently all data is obtained from op.gg

This project abides by rules stated by OP.GG in https://help.op.gg/hc/en-us/articles/31091405109401-I-want-to-use-OP-GG-s-data#:~:text=While%20OP.GG%20generally%20does,may%20result%20in%20usage%20restrictions. and in https://www.op.gg/robots.txt.
